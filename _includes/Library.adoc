==== Organization of assets

Click on the `+` and the `-` to unfold and fold the categories of the Library.

image:AssetsLibrary_1.png[Assets Library]

1.	Search area in order to quickly find an asset.
2.	Button for creating/importing assets (see <<Create an Asset>>).
3.	Categories level of the Library. There are usually two categories as follows:

  a.  `Fundamentals`: Contains all default assets offered by NC3.
  b.  `EBIOS`: Contains assets inspired by EBIOS. These are assets containing non-optimized risk models.

4.	Sub-categories level.
5.	Asset level: These are the assets that must be dragged and dropped to the Risk Analysis area.

====	Asset Management

The information on each asset is different depending on its type: `Primary` or `Secondary`.
This concept is explained in detail in the <<Type of assets>> section.

=====	Primary asset

Click on a primary asset of the Library, usually categorized in `Fundamentals` -> `Primary Assets`.

image:PrimaryAssets_1_800.png[Primary Assets]

1.	Asset management context menu (details in the <<Context menu of Library>>).
2.	Add an existing asset in the structure, creating a composed asset. There is no limit to the asset tree.
3.	Ability to detach assets from analysis.
4.	Table of operational risks possibly associated with the asset.

WARNING: Detaching an asset from the analysis will remove all its evaluation.

NOTE: A primary asset cannot possess information security risks.
The modification of the operational risk table is based on the knowledge base.

===== Secondary assets

Click on a secondary asset of the Library, for example on `Building` classified in `Fundamentals` -> `Buildings & Premises`.

image:SecondaryAssets_1_800.png[Secondary Assets]

1.	Asset management context menu (details in the <<Context menu of Library>>).
2.	Add an existing asset in the structure, creating a compound asset. There is no limit to the asset tree.
3.	Indication if the asset is already part of the composition of another asset. In this case, it is already a sub-element of the assets `Back Office`.
4.	Indication if this asset is currently used in the analysis. In this case, it is found at the 3rd level of the root of the risk analysis.
5.	Ability to detach assets from analysis.
6.	Risk information table associated with the asset.

WARNING: Detaching an asset from the analysis will remove all its evaluation.

NOTE: Conversely, in the case of primary assets, media assets can only have information risks.
The risk table is modified from the knowledge base.

===== Context menu of the Library

By clicking on the icon image:Menu.png[context menu,pdfwidth=4%,width=4%], the following context menu appears. Whatever the asset type of the library, the menu is the same.

image:LibraryContextMenu_1_800.png[Library Context Menu]

1.	Starts the pop-up that allows you to modify most of the parameters of an asset (see <<Edit an asset>>).
2.	Create a copy of the asset named `Name (copy #)`, which is then renamed with the `Edit Asset` option.
3.	Launches asset export pop-up (see <<Exporting an asset>>).
4.  Publish an asset in MOSP
4.	Delete an asset.
+
WARNING: Delete action is definitive, even if the asset is used in the analysis.

==== Create an Asset

In the Library, after clicking on the icon image:CreateButton.png[Add Asset,pdfwidth=4%,width=4%], the following pop-up appears:

image:AddAsset_1_800.png[Add Asset]

1.	To create an asset, it is also possible to import it (see <<Importing an asset>>). You have two options, you can import assets from the Asset import center, or MOSP.
2.	`Name`: This name must be unique for the analysis.
3.	`Label`: This is an additional description, it is displayed in the tooltip when you hover your mouse over an asset.
4.	`Scope`: Two possible choices:

  a.	`Local`: Identified asset risks are to be assessed whenever the asset is present in the analysis. A primary asset is generally local in scope.
  b.	`Global` image:Global.png[] : The risks of the asset are only to be assessed once for the whole analysis.
+

[NOTE]
========
This option is to be used mainly for the support assets, as soon as they are included in several primary assets.

*Example*: For the IT room or main building, once the risks are assessed, only the impact of the primary asset can change the level of risk.
========

+

5.	`Asset type`: It determines the nature of the asset and the risk model associated with it.
6.	`Category`: It is the location of the Library where the asset is stored. By clicking on the + sign, a new category can be created.
7.	`Operational risk Tag`: It allows the asset to be associated with operational risks by default.
+

[NOTE]
========
This option is enabled only when the asset type is a primary (*i.e*. Information, process, container or service)
========

+

8.	`Location`: Allows you to order assets in the selected category.

==== Edit an asset

An asset can be edited in the Context menu of the Library (when the asset is selected in the Library).

For an explanation of all fields that can be changed, see <<Create an Asset>>. For technical reasons, the modification does not make it possible to modify:

* `Scope`
* `Asset type`

==== Importing an asset

This pop-up is accessible from the pop-up <<Create an Asset, Add a new asset>> image:CreateButton.png[pdfwidth=4%,width=4%]

image:Import.png[Import]

1.	The import principle requires that the imported asset remains in the category in which it is located. Two import methods are possible:

  a.	`By duplicating`: When importing, if an asset of the same name exists, it will be duplicated and the name with a suffix `- Imp #n`.
  b.	`By merging`: When importing, if an asset of the same name exists, it will be replaced. In this case, only the associated risk model will be modified.
+

[NOTE]
========
Only global assets can be imported by merging.
========

+

2.	`Import from file`: This allows the transfer of assets from one environment to another (see <<Importing an asset from a file>>).
3.	`Import from MONARC Library`: This option is not available in the case of a _Stand-alone_ version of MONARC (see <<Import from the MONARC library>>).

WARNING: The import of an uncontrolled asset can be destructive for the current analysis. It is strongly advised to create a <<Snapshots, Snapshot>> before importing or to use an empty <<Creating a Risk Analysis, Sandbox>> analysis.

=====	Importing an asset from a file

The pop-up appears after clicking on the `Import from file` option in the `Asset Import center`.

image:AssetImportCenter_1_800.png[Asset Import Center]

1.	`Choose File`: Access the directories of the computer to point to a file.
2.	`Asset password`: When exporting the selected file, a password is used to encrypt the file. Please enter the password to be used here.
3.	`Import file`: Starts importing a file.

===== Import from the MONARC Library

The pop-up appears after clicking on the `Import from MONARC Library` option in the `Asset Import center`.

1. Click the + icon (Add an asset)
2. In the Add an asset window, choose the option ‘Asset import center’.
3. Choose MONARC Library

image:AssetImportCenter_2_800.png[Asset Import Center]

1.	Table of available assets in the MONARC common Library.
2.	`Action`: Initiate the import procedure for the corresponding asset.

==== Exporting an asset

To export an asset, click on the asset you want to export. Then click the `Asset management context menu` and choose the option ‘Export asset’:

image:ExportAsset_2.png[Export Asset]

The ‘Export asset’ window opens where you can decide whether you want to export your asset with a custom password or without a password.

image:ExportAsset_1.png[Export Asset]

1. `Custom password`: Option to encrypt the generated JSON file with a symmetric password, which is required during the import.
2. `Without password`: If you choose this option, the JSON file will not be encrypted.

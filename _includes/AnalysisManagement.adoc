1.	Access to the steps of the method: Click on the numbers from `1` to `4` to access the menus which follow the step-by-step method (see <<Method steps call>>).
2.	Asset library area: Asset storage. The _drag-and-drop_ function must be used to place these assets in the analysis (see <<Library>>).
3.	Risk Analysis area: allows you to structure the assets of the analysis hierarchically by using the _Drag and Drop_ function
(hold down the left mouse button to move an asset). (See <<Information Risks>> and <<Operational Risks>>)
4.	Contextual area of work in the analysis: Depending on the assets and active parts of the analysis, this area contains contextual elements of the work.

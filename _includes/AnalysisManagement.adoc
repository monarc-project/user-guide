The main view of risk analysis consists of 4 distinct parts.

1.	Access to the steps of the method: Click on the numbers from `1` to `4` to access the menus which follow the step-by-step method (see <<Method steps call>>).
2.	Risk Analysis area: allows you to structure the assets of the analysis hierarchically by using the _Drag and Drop_ function
(hold down the left mouse button to move an asset). (See <<Information Risks>> and <<Operational Risks>>)
3.	Asset library area: Asset storage. The _drag-and-drop_ function must be used to place these assets in the analysis (to move them to the Risk Analysis Area) (see <<Library>>).
4. Contextual area of work in the analysis: Depending on the assets and active parts of the analysis, this area contains contextual elements of the work.

=== Risk analysis management

You can manage your analysis in two steps as follows:

1. First, click on the name of the analysis

2.  Import a risk analysis - you can import a complete risk analysis.
    The file format is JSON and the structure can be viewed by exporting an analysis. There are 2 possible options of the export:
    - By merging (default). When matched assets names are not duplicated in the library.
    - By duplication. When the library assets are duplicated in case if presented before. The analysis assets will also be duplicated.

WARNING: An analysis can be only imported when the language of its creation is the same as the current analysis (into which import is performed)!

3.  Export the whole risk analysis - you can export the whole analysis with or without the assets library and the knowledge base.
The export of the analysis can be done with the following options:
- The export file can be protected by a password if it is set (Custom password option).
- "Include assets library?" The whole assets library is included in the export if the option is selected.
- "Include knowledge base?" The whole knowledge base is included in the export if the option is selected.
- “Export with assessments?” All the evaluations are included. Optionally can be added or not different analysis evaluation criteria (Options section).

==== Risks table

Below is an example of an Operational Risk table.

image:OperationalRisk_1_800.png[Operational Risk Table]

To reach this table, please follow the steps as follows:

1.	Select the primary asset. In this case, `GDPR legal obligations`.
2.	Click on the tab `Operational risks`.
3.	The figure shows the total operational risks associated with the primary asset.
4.	By selecting the relevant radio button, you can choose specific risks based on the risk acceptance threshold.
5.	Ability to sort most columns of the table. The sort can be done by Asset, Position, Net probability, Net risk, and Residual risk. The sort direction can be Ascending or Descending.

NOTE: The operational risk table may or may not display the inherent risks. They are the operational risks that would impact the organization without any controls in place.
To show this option see <<Creating a Risk Analysis>>.

1.	`Asset`: Assets involved in the evaluation
2.	`Risk description`: Description of risk
3.	`Inherent risk`: Operational risk is calculated from the two factors, the probability (`Prob.`) of the risk scenario and the `Impact` based on the ROLFPfootnote:[rolfp] without controls in place. The current risk represents the maximum value of the probability of the ROLFP impact values.
4.	`Net risk`: Net risk represents the risk of the measures currently in place. The calculation is the same as for the inherent risks.
5.	`Existing controls`: Describe here, in a factual manner, the control in place.
6.	`Treatment`: Indication if the risk is treated and risk profile (see <<Operational risk sheet>>).
7.	`Residual risk` : Value of the residual risk. In the case of the figure above, the residual risk is equal to the maximum risk because it has not yet been treated.

====	Operational risk sheet

In the risk analysis, click on an asset and choose the Operational risk tab. 
Then, in the ‘Kind of treatment’ dropdown menu choose ‘Not treated’. The not treated assets should appear in the table.

Click on the `Not treated` link in the operational risk table, so the risk card is displayed.

1.	`Current risk`: Values for risk probability (`Prob.`) and ROLFPfootnote:[rolfp] Criteria.
2.	`Residual risk` : Values for risk probability and ROLFPfootnote:[rolfp] criteria (not yet treated). Those values should be adjusted according to the recommendation and the measures that will be put in place.
Reminders of the parameters of the risk table.
3	`Asset`: the name of the asset
4	`Risk description`: the description of the risk
5.	`Recommmendations` : Creation / Assignment button for adding one or more recommendations.
6. `Kind of treatment` : Selection of the type of risk treatment (Not treated, Reduction, Denied, Accepted, or Shared).
7. `Security referentials` (ISO 27002, NIST Core, etc.)

NOTE: Once the validation has been done, the risk is treated.

==== Adding additional risk

You can add further risks to your risk table. Select an asset in the risk analysis and click on the ‘Create a specific risk’ link below the risk table:

image:AddingRisk_1_800.png[Operational Specific Risk]

1.	Click to `create a specific risk`: A pop-up appears and allows a new risk to be associated with the current asset. 
If the risk does not exist, it can be created directly. In the popup window, you can decide whether you want to add an existing risk or create a new one:

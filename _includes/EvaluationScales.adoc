To reach the ‘Evaluation scales’ menu, use the contextual menu (three-dot menu) in the top right-hand corner of the application.

Once you click on the three-dot menu, a submenu opens. Choose the submenu ‘Evaluation scales’:

image:EvaluationScales_2_400.png[Evaluation Scale Context Menu]

The screen has three tabs as follows:

1. Information risks
2. Operational risks
3. Compliance

This chapter is divided into three parts accordingly.

=== Information risks

The `Evaluation scales` window opens which has the following parts (from top to bottom):

1.	Impacts and consequences scale
2.	Likelihood scale
3.	Vulnerabilities scale
4.	Acceptance thresholds of information risks

NOTE: All scales are editable and customizable.

WARNING: However, it is no longer permitted to modify scales as soon as an evaluation has been encoded.

==== Impacts and consequences scale

The first section of the Evaluation scales window is the ‘Impacts and consequences scale’ table. It is a fully customizable table, by clicking on its different parts, you can edit it.

image:ImpactScale_1_800.png[Impact Scale]

1.	Click to modify the number of scales.
2.	Click `Show hidden impacts` to show or hide the criteria not used in the analysis.
3.	Click edit the headings of each scale.
4.  Click the symbol to hide an unused column.
5.	Click the `New column name` to add new impact criteria.

Please note that you can edit the headings and the content of the cells by simply clicking on them, allowing you to provide different values or explanations.

==== Likelihood scale

The Likelihood scale is the second part of the window. It is a fully customizable table, by clicking on its different parts, you can edit it.
In the below example, there are only five scale values of the scale between 0-4.

You can modify it easily. Just click on any of the values and give a different value: the Impacts and consequences scale table will change accordingly.

Just like with the scale values, you can also modify the description/explanation of the values by clicking on them and giving a different description/explanation.

====  Vulnerability scale

The third section of the Evaluation scales window is the ‘Vulnerability scale’ table. 
It is a fully customizable table, by clicking on its different parts, you can edit it.

1.	Click to modify the number of scales.
2.	Click to edit the heading on each scale (Management identical to the impact scale).

==== Acceptance thresholds

The fourth section of the Evaluation scales window is the ‘Acceptance thresholds’ table. 
There are two separate tables for acceptability thresholds, as operational risks and information risks are not calculated in the same way.
Information risks are calculated using three criteria:

1. Modification of threshold levels of information risks. The table displayed above (as well as the risk analysis tables) is updated automatically.
2. Information risks are calculated using three criteria: `Impact x Threat x Vulnerability`.


=== Operational risk scales

To reach the ‘Evaluation scales’ menu, use the contextual menu (three-dot menu) in the top right-hand corner of the application and choose the submenu 'Evaluation scales'.
The Operational risks screen can be reached by clicking on the second tab of the screen 'Operatioanl risks'.

The Operational risks screen consists of three parts as follows:

1. Impact scale
2. Likelihood scale
3. Acceptance threshods of operational risks

==== Impacts scale

==== ....


The acceptance threshold table for operational risks is different. To reach it, you should click on the ‘Operational risks’ tab at the top of the  Evaluation scales window.

1. Modification of threshold levels of operational risks. The table displayed above (as well as the risk analysis tables) is updated automatically.
2. Operational risks are calculated using two criteria: `Impact x Probability`.

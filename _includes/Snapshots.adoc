Snapshots allow you to create a full backup for analysis.

NOTE: It is a function to be used regularly throughout the process, both before and after major changes, as it provides the only way to track and reference those changes.

The menu is always accessible from the main view of MONARC:

To reach the Snapshot functionality, first, click on the contextual menu image:Menu.png[pdfwidth=4%,width=4%] in the upper right-hand corner.

You can do the following actions:

.	`View` the snapshot
.	`Restore` the snapshot. Caution: this option will overwrite the current analysis!
.	`Delete` the snapshot you created.

When you leave the popup window by clicking on the ‘X’ in the upper right-hand corner, you will see the snapshot view. A message informs you that you are curently on a snapshot and you cannot make any changes.

Click on the ‘Return to risk analysis’ link to back to your risk analysis.

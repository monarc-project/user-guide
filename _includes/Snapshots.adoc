Snapshots allow you to create a full backup for analysis.

NOTE: It is a function to be used regularly throughout the process, both before and after major changes, as it provides the only way to track and reference those changes.

The menu is always accessible from the main view of MONARC:

1.	To reach the Snapshot functionality, first, click on the contextual menu image:Menu.png[pdfwidth=4%,width=4%] in the upper right-hand corner.

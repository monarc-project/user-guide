1. *Source*: The creation of a risk analysis is always based on an existing model. There are two choices for this:
a.	`List of risks models`: This option proposes available models in the knowledge bases. It has at least two choices, `Modelling NC3`, and the `Blank model`.
Modelling NC3 is the default template made available by the MONARC editor. It provides sufficient knowledge bases to start a risk analysis. This option should be used by default to start a new risk analysis. 
The Blank model is empty. This template is typically used temporarily as a Sandbox to test the contents of an import file, for example.
b.	`Existing analysis`: By choosing this radio button, you can duplicate the risk analysis of your choice present in your environment.
2.	*Description*: Give a meaningful description of your risk analysis.
3.	*Language*: From the dropdown menu, choose a preferred language you want to use for your risk analysis (French, English, German, or Dutch).
4.	*Name*: Give a name to your risk analysis.
5.	*Description*: An optional field, which allows you to describe your analysis in more detail.

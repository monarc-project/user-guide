1.	The creation of a risk analysis is always based on an existing model. There are two choices for this:
a.	`List of risks models`: Proposes available models in the knowledge bases. This option has at least two choices, `Modelling NC3`,
this is the default template made available by the MONARC editor. It provides sufficient knowledge bases to start a risk analysis.
This option should be used by default to start a new risk analysis. There is also the choice `Blank model` which is a completely empty model.
This template is typically used temporarily as a _Sandbox_ to test the contents of an import file, for example.
b.	`Existing analysis`: Duplicate risk analysis of your choice present in your environment.
2.	Options *_a_* or *_b_* before being selected. It gets the source.
3.	Select the preferred language for this new risk analysis. MONARC only present the languages actually available in the selected source.
4.	Give a name to risk analysis.
5.	Optional field, which allows you to describe your analysis in more detail.
